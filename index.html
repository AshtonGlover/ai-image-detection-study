        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          With this rise of generative AI, I sought to build a program that
          could detect whether images were taken by a camera or generated with
          AI. This program utilizes CNNs with the TensorFlow library to
          determine whether or not an image is real or AI-Generated using two
          pixel-wise feature extraction techniques, ELA (Error Level Analysis)
          and PRNU (Photo Response Non-Uniformity). The model was trained on a
          dataset called CIFAKE which is made up of 100,000 images for training
          (50,000 real and 50,000 fake), as well as 20,000 images for testing
          (10,000 real and 10,000 fake). The images are preprocessed using ELA
          and PRNU before being passed to the model. I set up a simple web
          interface where a user can upload an image and let the model predict
          whether it is real or fake. This is done with a flask backend to pass
          the image to the saved model after it has been trained. This project
          is based on the research done in the following paper:

        <h2>ELA Specifics</h2>
        <p>
          One of the pixel-wise feature extraction techniques utilized for this
          project was ELA or Error Level Analysis. ELA is usually used to detect
          image editing, as when real photos are compressed, there should be
          gradual losses of detail reflecting the slight degradation of data.
          Since AI-generated images result from training on large datasets of
          real photographs, they should display abnormal shifts when ELA is
          performed. Below is a side by side of a real image before and after
          ELA.

        <h2>PRNU Specifics</h2>
        <p>
          PRNU, or Photo Response Non-Uniformity, arises from the noise patterns
          in cameras. Due to the impossible task of translating exactly what the
          eyes see to a real photograph, imperfections in cameras will result in
          a unique noise pattern. Because AI images do not come from a real
          camera, the PRNU pattern should not be rather inconsistent and
          unidentifiable. The PRNU pattern can be found by denoising the image
          and then subtracting it from the original image.

        <h2>Accuracy</h2>
        <img src="images/accuracy.png" alt="ela" />
        <p>
          As seen in the above graphs, both extraction techniques yielded strong
          results for predicting whether or not images were real or
          AI-generated. During training, the accuracy for both techniques
          steadily increased through the ten epochs, with much more variable
          accuracy during the validation phase. For this experiment, ELA yielded
          slightly better results than PRNU.
